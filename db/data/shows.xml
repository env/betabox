	Boston comedy staple Robert Kelly has decided it is time to unleash his hilarity on the unassuming Washington DC public. Luckily, Riot Act will be the stage, July 27th - 29th, to witness this event. Robert was cast as Louis CK&#39;s brother in the first season of the hit FX show "Louie." Robert has also been featured on Last Call with Carson Daly, Tough Crowd with Colin Quiin, and Premium Blend. The abrasive yet refreshing style of Robert is what has made him so endearing for the past 18 years. We think that&#39;s why Dane Cook invited him on his "Tourgasm" tour and why the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival had him perform in 2010. Really, there&#39;s no good reason NOT to come see the hilarious Robert Kelly. So come on out DC, laughs on us!</p>
<p>
	You can visit Robert&#39;s website <a href="http://www.whosay.com/robertkelly/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
	You should definitely follow Robert on twitter here: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/robertkelly">@robertkelly&nbsp;</a></p>

	Rachel Feinstein grew up outside Washington DC, the daughter of a civil rights lawyer and a blues musician, giving her a keen eye for the absurd and unjust. So really, this is like a homecoming for Rachel, and we couldn&#39;t be more excited. She developed her hilarious, character-driven style by opening for her father&#39;s blues band as a kid and doing impressions of various loud and jarring relatives. Rachel was a finalist on Season 7 of "Last Comic Standing," she was featured on "Russell Simmon&#39;s Presents Live at the El Ray," and she has had her own half hour special "Comedy Central Presents" Rachel Feinstein. This incredible, hilarious comic is sure to entertain. Come on out DC and learn about Rachel Feinstein before she gets any more succesful!</p>

After SF Weekly selected her as &ldquo;The Best Comedian of 2009&Prime; and the SF Bay Guardian awarded her &ldquo;Best of the Bay,&rdquo; she decided that it was finally time to depart her hometown. Since then, Ali has performed on &ldquo;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&rdquo;, the FOX series &ldquo;Breaking In&rdquo;, E!&rsquo;s &ldquo;50 Super Epic TV Moments&rdquo;, and can be seen in Oliver Stone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Savages&rdquo; to be released later this year. In 2010, Comedy Central listed Ali Wong as one of 7 &ldquo;Comic&rsquo;s to Watch&rdquo; and Ali appeared in the 2011 Just for LaughsComedy Festival in Montreal, QC. She is currently a series regular on NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Are You There, Chelsea?&rdquo; So come out and see this hilarious star in the making in her DC debut...laughs on us.&nbsp;</p>

	Josh Wolf started doing comedy in Seattle 12 years ago.&nbsp; After moving to Los Angeles, his unique, honest, and high energy style of storytelling made him an instant favorite at The Improv, The Laugh Factory, and The World Famous Comedy Store.&nbsp; He also caught the eye of network TV.&nbsp; After doing his first one man show at the HBO Workspace, Josh landed a two year talent deal at 20th Century Fox and ABC for his own television show.&nbsp; Although his show never made the air, Josh learned a lot from watching people develop and write scripts. He learned so much that he decided to write one himself and he sold it to NBC.&nbsp; It was titled &ldquo;Fairly Normal&rdquo; and it, too, was to have Josh in the starring role.&nbsp; Being bit by the writing bug, Josh wrote on sitcoms for the next four years, working on shows like &ldquo;Yes, Dear&rdquo;, Will Smith&#39;s &ldquo;All of Us&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cuts,&rdquo; starring Shannon Elizabeth. As he was wondering whether to go back for another season of writing, Josh decided he was tired of making other people funny and he jumped back into stand-up.&nbsp; He was immediately cast in Last Comic Standing and was on the season finale as one of the Last Comics Downloaded.&nbsp; Since then he has had acting roles on &ldquo;All of Us&rdquo;, a recurring role on &ldquo;My Name is Earl,&rdquo; and he has done several hosting gigs for E!.</p>
<p>
	He&#39;s currently a regular on the hit E! series, &ldquo;Chelsea Lately,&rdquo; and is touring with Larry The Cable Guy and Chelsea Handler. Josh is also co-writing a feature for Sony and Happy Madison and hosts &ldquo;The College Experiment,&rdquo; a comedic weekly online college football show for Fox Sports. This year he will be touring with &ldquo;The Comedians of Chelsea Lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Josh Wolf is truly one of the most well rounded entertainers in the business and a show you just can&#39;t afford to miss.</p>

	It is election season.&nbsp; We know.&nbsp; The air in DC is getting heavy.&nbsp; The temperature is rising.&nbsp; The tension is bubbling over.&nbsp; We need someone to point out the folley in the serious, the silly in the mundane, the idiocracy in the routine.&nbsp; That man is long time prolific writer, Emmy nominee, political humorist, all-around great guy, Will Durst! So please, don&#39;t wait any longer to chuckle furiously at the ridiculouseness of the campaign trail. Don&#39;t waste any more time with snide, under-your-breath, remarks. Don&#39;t sit idly by in your corduroy recliner talking to yourself about Mitt Romney&#39;s immaculately clean scalp. Embrace the hilarity. Point out the crazy. Say what you feel OUT LOUD. That&#39;s what Will does. His shows are brought to you by the First Amendment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Will has performed all over the world making a mockery of our political system. He has performed in front Bill Clinton, George HW Bush, &amp; Al Gore. He has appeared on Late Night with David Letterman, Comedy Central, HBO, &amp; Showtime. And now, he will be performing for YOU, May 10 - 12 at Riot Act Comedy Theater. So come on out and laugh at our very own system of check, balances, and imbalances with the country&#39;s premier political satirist, Will Durst.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Visit Will&#39;s website <a href="http://willdurst.com/">here</a></p>

	When&rsquo;s the last time you saw Wendy Williams, Diana Ross, Mo&rsquo;Nique, Whoopi Goldberg and First Lady Michelle Obama in one evening&rsquo;s performance? Well, all you need to do is catch the Sylvia Traymore Morrison Show at Riot Act. Originally from Washington, DC, Sylvia is the only renowned African American Female Impressionist in the country.&nbsp; She was one of the first solo artists to tour and open for Whitney Houston when Ms. Houston was one of the biggest names in the entertainment business.&nbsp; The arenas they performed in sometimes housed well over 30,000 people.</p>
<p>
	When heavyweight boxing was at its zenith and Muhammad Ali was in his prime, Sylvia was asked to host a Roast of the Champ at the legendary Apollo Theater. The hosting job was so prolific and the imitation of the World Heavyweight Champion was so spot-on that he looked at her in amazement and said, &ldquo;You&#39;&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; me? A woman doin&rsquo; me? That&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	As a result of that roast, Sylvia was offered a position as an associate-writer for one of America&rsquo;s longest-running TV shows, Saturday Night Live.&nbsp; She is one of few African American Women offered that position.&nbsp; Since that time Sylvia has opened for some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry, including Gladys Knight, Chaka Khan, The Temptations, and Cher. Most recently, she has worked with Yolanda Adams and Marcus D. Wiley.</p>
<p>
	As the result of her profound career, Sylvia has released her first book, based on her true story, entitled "Almost There, Almost...The Many Faces of Sylvia Traymore Morrison."</p>
<p>

<p>
	Voted the Best Blues Band in the Mid Atlantic Region 12 years in a row, the Kelly Bell Band from Baltimore, Maryland is &ldquo;among the most genre-expanding acts on today&rsquo;s blues scene. Who else can combine elements of hip-hop, funk, and blues-electrified here, Delta there, horn driven elsewhere- and still manage to sound sincere? A forward view of the way blues is transitioning in today&rsquo;s scene&hellip;Bell&rsquo;s an honest poet and an outstanding singer with lots to say. &rdquo; Blues Revue Magazine.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Formed as a backup band for Bo Diddley, the Kelly Bell Band is now in its sixteenth year of playing, recording, and entertaining fans. The KBB released their debut album, Phat Blues Music in 1998. It remains one of the best selling CDs in Mid-Atlantic region history. The band followed with the equally successful studio albums Ain&rsquo;t Like it Used to Be in 2001 and Chasing the Sun in 2002. In March 2004, the KBB released their first live album &ldquo;Live From the Recher Theatre&hellip;Finally&rdquo; to much industry acclaim.</p>

	Originally from Detroit, comedian, actor, writer and (sometimes) director Tony T. Roberts has been blessed with the coveted honor of being the, &ldquo;Comedians-comedian.&rdquo;&nbsp; The guy other performers love to watch work.&nbsp; His hilarious and refreshing energetic comedy style has granted him respect and created a huge demand for him on the comedy circuit, here in the states and abroad.&nbsp; Legendary comedian and sitcom director, David Steinberg, acclaimed Tony as, &ldquo;A breakout talent&rdquo; after witnessing Tony&rsquo;s stand-up act and casting him as the lead in a series of funny burger king commercials he directed.</p>

<p>
	Soon after, HBO noticed Tony&rsquo;s rising star and sent him to be featured at the 11th Annual U.S. Comedy Festival in Aspen Colorado.&nbsp; Upon returning, Tony was asked to return to the stage again for HBO, this time due to popular demand from his initial performance on HBO&rsquo;s &ldquo;DEF COMEDY JAM.&rdquo; He would later appear in the Season premiere of Russell Simmons presents, Comedy at the El Rey for Comedy Central.&nbsp; Shortly After, Showtime Network and Salient Media placed there stamp of approval on&nbsp; Tony, and agreed to tape and air his one hour comedy special, WIRED!&nbsp; Which aired in January 2010 and was the most sold comedy special of the year for Salient Media.&nbsp; The DVD is nationally featured in Walmart&rsquo;s across the nation.</p>
<p>

As a host, Tony recently hosted the vh1 pilot &ldquo;Dance Slam Cam, &rdquo; and a Guest Lead in &ldquo;Nite Tales&rdquo; for BET and recently sat on the couch as guest on The Monique Show.&nbsp; Keep an eye on Tony Roberts&hellip;America&rsquo;s next great talent!!!!</p>

	With Dan Naturman, Wali Collins and Shaun Eli!</p>
<p>
	The show features clean, clever stand-up comedy performed by those best qualified to be snobby and brag about it&mdash; professional comedians who went to Ivy League schools.&nbsp; And then disappointed their parents by quitting Wall Street or the law firm to tell jokes to drunks for less money than you can imagine anyone living on in NYC.</p>
<p>
	This provides a perfect opportunity for you to impress your date with how well-connected you are.&nbsp; She may even believe that you finished college despite the fact that it&rsquo;s only your high school diploma that you display on your bathroom wall.</p>
<p>
	And since the comics are clean you don&#39;t have to worry about any content offending her, at least until you open your mouth afterwards and dirty words come spilling out.&nbsp; But by then she&rsquo;ll be convinced that you&rsquo;re smart and erudite, especially if you manage to work words like &lsquo;erudite&rsquo; into your pre-show conversation and ply her with some fancy drinks from the club&rsquo;s impressive drink menu.</p>

	Bobcat is here! Born in the outskirts of Hollywood (Syracuse, New York) in 1962, Bobcat Goldthwait wrote and directed his first film &ldquo;Shakes The Clown&rdquo; in 1991. A dark cult comedy, &ldquo;Shakes&rdquo; was heralded by the Boston Globe as the &ndash;&ldquo;Citizen Cane of Alcoholic clown movies, and lays claim to such fans as Martin Scorsese and Michael Stipe&rdquo; &ndash; in fact; the REM song &ldquo;Binky the Doormat&rdquo; was based on a line from &ldquo;Shakes The Clown&rdquo;.&nbsp; Goldthwait&rsquo;s next movie &ldquo;Windy City Heat&rdquo; appeared in the Cine Vegas Film Festival in 04 and won best film at the Montreal Comedy Festival that year. Matt Stone (co-creator of South Park) has called &ldquo;Windy City Heat&rdquo; &ndash;&ldquo;beyond genius&rdquo; and Vice Magazine called it, -&ldquo;quite simply the greatest movie of all time&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sleeping Dogs Lie&rdquo; marked Bobcat&rsquo;s third feature film as a director. Written by Goldthwait, and financed by friends and pawn shops, the movie was shot entirely during a two week hiatus from his job directing &ldquo;Jimmy Kimmel Live&rdquo;. The film was chosen to compete in Sundance&rsquo;s 2006 Dramatic competition, and was also in the London, Toronto, and San Sebastian Film Festivals that year. &ldquo;Sleeping Dogs Lie&rdquo; was hailed as &ldquo;earnest and improbably moving&rdquo; by Esquire Magazine, and &ldquo;demonically funny and surprisingly sweet&rdquo; by Rolling Stone. Bobcat credits his failure to appear in the film as a good part of its success.&nbsp; Bobcat&#39;s new movie &ldquo;God Bless America&rdquo; was featured at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival as one of the festivals Midnight Madness picks. Goldthwait&#39;s new black comedy stars Joel Murray and Tara Lynne Barr. It&#39;s a modern Bonnie &amp; Clyde in which a middle-aged guy and a young girl go on a killing spree inspired by hatred for the garbage glut of MTV &lsquo;reality&rsquo; shows.<br />
	Check out the trailer here <a href="http://youtu.be/ul4CZrnEFxU">http://youtu.be/ul4CZrnEFxU</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/godblessamericamovie">http://www.facebook.com/godblessamericamovie</a><br />
	<br />
	In 2009 Magnolia pictures released Goldthwait&rsquo;s film &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Greatest Dad&rdquo;. The movie stars long time friend Robin Williams, and was again made independently from the studio system with a cast made up primarily of close friends, (although this time Process and Darko Productions came on board and prevented any pawn shops from having to be involved). The movie was met with rave reviews; &ldquo;HILARIOUS&rdquo; &ndash; Washington Post, &ldquo;See it. A gem with a terrific, remarkably funny script.&rdquo;&ndash; At the Movies, &ldquo;Scandalously entertaining!&rdquo;&ndash; Village Voice, &ldquo;****&rdquo; &ndash; Time Out Chicago,&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonderful&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp; MTV.&nbsp; Also at Sundance in 2009 was Bobcat&rsquo;s short film &ldquo;Goldthwait Home Movies: Anniversary Edition&rdquo;.&nbsp; Upon hearing that he would have 2 separate films at the festival this year, Bobcat reportedly cried like a little baby girl. &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Greatest Dad&rdquo; is now out on DVD.<br />
	<br />
	Bobcat directed the new movie-musical that he wrote based on The Kink&rsquo;s 1976 concept album, Schoolboys in Disgrace.&nbsp; Goldthwait&rsquo;s script tells the story of a schoolboy and his gang who are constantly in trouble with their teachers and fellow pupils.&nbsp; One day, the student is humiliated by his headmaster and vows to fight back against &ldquo;the Establishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; The new flick will unfold the genesis story of a supervillian set to some of the greatest rock songs you&rsquo;ll ever hear.&nbsp; It includes the world&rsquo;s most charming criminal and a realistic high school musical for all the kids who hate sugary, sweet, unrealistic high-school musical.&nbsp; The songs for the film were written by former Kink&rsquo;s frontman Ray Davies in which the cast for the movie will re-record the original songs for the film&rsquo;s soundtrack.<br />
	<br />
	Goldthwait has come a long way from his first appearance on David Letterman at the age of 20. In addition to directing movies Bobcat has lent his behind the camera talents to shows such as; Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Demetri Martin show, The Chappelle Show, The Man Show, and Crank Yankers.&nbsp; Best known for his unforgettable movies that were huge in the 80&#39;s, Bobcat has also starred in several HBO specials and a slew of television appearances to numerous to mention.&nbsp; Bob continues to push the envelope with his unique brand of humor headlining major comedy clubs across the country and all of this has allowed him to live in an impossibly luxurious rental home in the Los Angeles area.</p>

	There are only a few chances in life to actually see a legend in action. March 21st thru March 25th you will be able to do exactly this at Riot Act Comedy Theater with the arrival of Paul Mooney.</p>
<p>
	Mooney&#39;s years and contributions to the comedy world cannot be summed up in this small paragraph, but to list a few, he was head writer for "The Chappelle Show" with Dave Chappelle where he also appeared as "Negrodamus" and in the sketch "Ask A Black Dude." He was writer for Redd Foxx and "Sanford and Son," for Jimmy Walker and "Good Times" and head writer for the immortal Richard Pryor including Richard&#39;s films "Live on the Sunset Strip," "Is It Something I Said" and his unforgettable appearances on "Saturday Night Live." Mooney also created &#39;Homie D. Clown&#39; for Fox&#39;s "In Living Color" and has appeared in the films "Hollywood Shuffle," "Bamboozled," "Which Way Is Up" and one of Riot Act&#39;s favorite&#39;s....."Bustin&#39; Loose" to name a few.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	Opening for Paul is the hilarious Alycia Cooper, the first female comic to perform on &ldquo;The Mo&rsquo;Nique Show,&rdquo;&nbsp; Alycia has also been a featured comic on NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent,&rdquo; BET&rsquo;s &ldquo;Comicview,&rdquo; Comedy Central&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wanda Does It,&rdquo; &ldquo;Byron Allen&rsquo;s Comics Unleashed,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Gossip Queens&rdquo; on Logo, several VH-1 clips shows and BET&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oh Drama.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>
	Forged from the embers of a dying star, this wandering band of minstrels have become gods in the land of comedy. What once was four comedians joking their way through the halls of Washington DC, now stand a tour united under the common banner of Pop Culture and Nerd-dom. This is something you definitely do not want to miss!</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	COMEDY CLUBS? Destroyed with laughter by the tour.</p>
<p>
	COLLEGES? Ravaged with hilarity by the tour.</p>
<p>
	CONVENTIONS? Pillaged of their sadness by the tour.</p>
<p>
	This February 15th, make ready your funny bones, for they will be BROKEN.</p>
<p>
	With years of stand up experience under their belts, the Geek Comedy Tour is coming to the Riot Act Comedy Theater, complete with free swag from its comic shop sponsors, to show you what comedy is and what it shall forever be.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Valentine&#39;s Day is DEAD! LONG LIVE THE TOUR!</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<u><strong>The Intergalactic Line Up Includes:</strong></u></p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Chris Barylick</strong><br />
	The founder of the Geek Comedy Tour 3000 and a nerd at heart, Chris uses an energetic mix of pop culture, everyday humor and tech/nerd triviata to make fun of the things closest to him. He has performed at various venues throughout DC, Maryland, New York and Virginia and on Sirius satellite radio.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Joe Deeley</strong><br />
	Joe Deeley is a man who is serious about being silly. Throughout the past decade, Joe has been making a name for himself in the pre-apocalyptic wasteland world of comedy from Washington D.C. to Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles, California (not to be confused with LA, the US Postal abbreviation for Louisiana). Joe&#39;s interests range from pirate movies, science fiction, and dragons, to flying machines, and absolutely ANYTHING to do with robots or spaceships.</p>
<p>
	From the arcane, to the mundane, but seldom through the profane, Joe&#39;s wonderfully weird and whimsical comedy pokes fun at himself, the world, and the ever increasing seriousness we all seem to be suffering from lately.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>James Jones</strong><br />
	A child of the Def Jam era James grew up listening to comics riff about the differences between black people and white people, yo mama jokes, and life in the &#39;hood. When he began his own stand-up career however, he found that the traditional Def Jam subject matter did not suit his style. So he developed his own brand of racial humor by talking about his experiences as a nerdy black man. With his economical writing style, smart material, and clipped delivery James quickly distinguished himself throughout the DC area comedy scene. His deadpan, wide-eyed observations make him a favorite of almost any crowd.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Evan Valentine</strong><br />
	Evan Valentine has been performing in the DC standup circuit for two years, getting his start as winner of the Last Comic Standing Competition at Loyola College in Maryland. Evan has performed comedy in one way or another for all his life, joining bands, tours, you name it, he&#39;s done it all for the name of hillarity.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<strong>Jake Young</strong><br />
	Loves stuff that is not real, also he likes making jokes. Thus the Geek Comedy Tour is the perfect place to do jokes about his favorite things that aren&#39;t. After a youth wasted drawing cartoons and adolescence take up by anime, Jake Young quickly took to live comedy after heavy exposure to gamma radiation and basic cable. After training and performing at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in NYC he quickly rose in the ranks of Beltway-area comedy, performing frequently at Showcase events and even doing guest spots at the DC Improv Comedy Club. You might have heard Jake Young on WGTB, XM Satelite Radio, or even on the CW network on the Season 4 premiere of "Beauty and the Geek". Furthermore, he&#39;s got uber-gusto.</p>

        <p>
	A four time "Addy" winner and a veteran of Comedy Central, MTV and A&amp;E, Basile created a one man show about what he knows best, what it is really like to grow up a Greek American in America. Basile&#39;s fine tuned high energy show highlights the the lighter side of the Greek Life and the Greek Spirit. Since its inception Basile has performed "Growing up Greek" all over the world and January 29th he will bring it to life at Riot Act Comedy Theater at 8PM.</p>
<p>
	"It really caters to those who either grew up with parents who came rom overseas and those who are first-generation and went through the hell of living in a conservative household in a wide-open American society and the problems we&#39;ve had," says Basile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Born and raised on Long Island, Basile alternates between stand-up comedy, acting as well as voiceover work and writing short stories. His voiceover work has included everything from a current project of redubbing Bullwinkle for remastered cartoons, Japanese anime and being the voice of sports commentator Jimmy the Greek in ESPN&#39;s "30 For 30" series, which earned him an Emmy nomination. About 90 percent of his show is performed in English and the rest in Greek. In other countries, he said, the ratio changes.</p>
<p>
	It is a great show about about people and meant to be enjoyed by Greeks and non-Greeks alike.&nbsp; If you liked "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" do not miss "Growing Up Greek in America"...it is hilarious.&nbsp;</p>

	Every month Riot Act will be featuring special shows showcasing comics from all one state or from all one city....in January will be our kick off featuring our lovely neighbor to the east and north...the state of Maryland.</p>
<p>
	Representing the mean streets of Silver Spring will be Maryland&#39;s own funky child Todd Rexx. &nbsp;A veteran of HBO&#39;s "P Diddy&#39;s Bad Boys of Comedy" and Showtime, T. Rexx returns home (he lives in LA now with all the other big shots) to claim the stage for MD. &nbsp;Really one of the funniest people you will see....even though his material is a high wire affair of dangerous and taboo subjects. &nbsp;</p>

	Riot Act Comedy Theater is THE place to be New Year&rsquo;s Eve with comedian Big Al Goodwin.&nbsp; One of the funniest comics to grace a stage, Al performs nationally and has toured with the biggest names in comedy including Jim Gaffigan, Dave Chappelle and Steven Wright.&nbsp; His hilarious, high energy, hysterical material keeps audiences laughing long after the show.&nbsp; Winner on &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Funniest People,&rdquo; Al was one of only 21 comics from around the country chosen to compete in HBO&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lucky 21 Contest&rdquo; in Las Vegas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our full menu will be available during both shows.&nbsp; Both the upstairs and downstairs bars will be open until 3AM.&nbsp; If you are coming to the 8PM show, you are welcome to stay after the show, as both bars will be pouring all night.&nbsp; So even if you aren&#39;t here for our extra-special, fancy-shmancy 10:30 show, there&#39;s no reason to ring in the New Year anywhere else!</p>
<p>
	Tickets are on sale NOW--so get them before they sell out!</p>
<p>
	<br />
	<u><strong>8:00 Show</strong></u>&nbsp; -&nbsp; <strong>$35</strong></p>
<p>
	Each Ticket includes:</p>
<p>
	- a VIP pass for 2 to a future show at Riot Act.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<u><strong>10:30 Countdown Show</strong></u>&nbsp; -&nbsp; <strong>$75</strong></p>
<p>
	Each ticket includes:</p>
<p>
	- a VIP pass for 2 to a future show at Riot Act.</p>
<p>
	- appetizer platter for each table</p>
<p>
	- party favors</p>
<p>
	- midnight champagne toast</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Again, both bars outside the showroom WILL be pouring all night, until last call, and the club will remain open until 3AM.&nbsp; So regardless of which show you attend, everyone is welcome to ring in 2012 here at Riot Act.&nbsp; Come for the comedy, stay for drinks.&nbsp; And more drinks.&nbsp; Hilarity ensues.</p>

	<br />
	Featuring interviews with former DC mayor <strong>Marion Barry</strong> and legendary adult film actress <strong>Nina Hartley</strong>.<br />
	With performances by comedian <strong>Kevin Barnett</strong>, spoken-word artist <strong>Lalibella</strong>, Musical guest&nbsp;<strong>Phil Ade</strong>, and sketches by our very own <strong>Ben Weinberg</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Join us on <strong>Sunday, December 11th</strong>, as we perform and film the pilot episode of The Channel Guide program before you, our esteemed live audience.</p>
<p>
	Channel 38 is a multimedia entertainment platform that aggregates innovative audio/video content from around the world&mdash;while intertwining it with our very own.&nbsp; The catch?&nbsp; We&rsquo;re (supposed to be) lawyers&hellip;. Please, help us escape this &ldquo;profession&rdquo; before it consumes us.&nbsp; At $15 a ticket, our rates are the best in town.</p>
<p>
	On demand?&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; And now here&rsquo;s your supply: The Channel Guide explores the humanity of taboo topics through interviews with public figures ranging from politicians to pornstars; performances from musical artists and comedians; video vignettes and viewer submissions; and news from around the globe.</p>
<p>
	It turns out that the law DOES allow a bit of creativity, and by George (Washington), we&rsquo;ll be damned if we don&rsquo;t give it to you.&nbsp; And give it to you good.&nbsp; For 90 minutes.</p>
<p>
	Think you&rsquo;ve heard all this before?&nbsp; Think you&rsquo;ve seen better?&nbsp; Well, I guess that&rsquo;s probably a safe bet.&nbsp; Either way, December 11, 2011 will be the DEBUT.&nbsp;&nbsp; Join us as we reinvent the wheel!</p>
<p>
	Doors open to the public at 6:30pm for a 75-minute happy hour.</p>

	Riot Act will be a much prettier place as well with the very funny and beautiful Tammy Pescatelli as our headliner. Growing up with all brothers gave a girl from Cleveland two things: a great sense of security and an even greater sense of humor. Indeed, comedian Tammy Pescatelli got her fair share of both, but her sense of humor is what has made her one of America&rsquo;s funniest&mdash;and hardest working&mdash;women of comedy. She made the Final Five on NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Comic Standing 2 ,&rdquo; she has appeared twice as a guest on &ldquo;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,&rdquo; and was in National Lampoon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Funny Money&rdquo;. Tammy also recently appeared in her own half-hour special for Comedy Central, &ldquo;Comedy Central Presents: Tammy Pescatelli&rdquo;, Comedy Central&rsquo;s &ldquo;The World Stands Up!&rdquo;, and is a frequent performer and fundraiser for Jerry Lewis&#39; Telethon. More recently, she has performed on &ldquo;TBS&rsquo;s Evening at the Laugh Factory,&rdquo; &ldquo;Last Call with Carson Daly&rdquo; and has been a guest a number of times on the syndicated show &ldquo;Comics Unleashed&rdquo; where her performance was chosen for their &ldquo;Best of the Best&rdquo; world wide top selling DVD! Tammy is special and a great option for your holiday night out with friends, coworkers or family.</p>
<p>
	Featuring on this show is the very funny Danny Rouhier and the MC is up and comer Abe Barth!</p>
