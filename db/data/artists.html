Born and raised in Washington D.C., CHICO never would’ve imagined that he<br />
would become a comedian, but one incident changed his views of life forever. Being critically wounded and hospitalized due to a gunshot wound in early 2001, he spent a lot of time in the hospital bed contemplating on his life changes and the path to take next. “I was watching an episode of Comic View on BET, and it hit me; these comics aren’t really all that, I can do that.” After recouping from his injury, he decided to put his actions to a test, and tried out comedy for the first time appearing at D.C.’s infamous Takoma Station nightclub. From then on, he knew that this was a career to embark on.</p>

<p>CHICO began hosting Takoma Station weekly while working other gigs at other comedy venues in the D.C. area. Within 3 years, CHICO had already performed with D.C.’s best; such as Joe Clair and Red Grant just to name a few. He was blessed to be chosen to perform at Howard University’s Homecoming Comedy Show; then selected to appear on the second season of B.E.T Coming to the Stage, he’s also been featured outside of D.C. headlining at the Virginia House of Comedy, Richmond Funnybone and opening up for big music acts such as R&amp;B singer Pleasure P (of Pretty Ricky) and soul music legends THE WHISPERS and the list goes on. Chico loves giving back to his community hosting charity events such as Make-a-Wish. Chico was recently featured on BET&#8217;s 106&amp;Park for the Martin Luther King Memorial Tribute. He is also a comedic writer who writes for several comedians in Washington D.C area.</p>

<p>Currently, CHICO is still hosting and performing at venues worldwide, as well as writing and producing shows. He’s the lead writer for the sketch shows “DMV Comedy Sit Down” and “CHICOMENTARY,” and he’s one of the writers and commentators on “Reel Critics.” His future goals are to write for a wide range of comedians as well as for sitcoms. CHICO’s dogma is to “Always stay focused.”

<p>Dean has made several late night appearances, including “The Late Show with Craig Ferguson” and “Last Call with Carson Daly.”&nbsp; He is also a favorite and frequent guest on Byron Allen’s “Comic Unleashed,” and is frequently providing comedic commentary on various VH1 highlight shows. Director Malcolm Lee also chose Dean to finish Bernie Mac&#8217;s voice/ADR work on &#8220;Soul Men&#8221; after the comedian’s untimely death.&nbsp; Dean also provided the voiceover of Barack Obama&#8217;s on the CNN’s show, “D.L. Hughley Breaks the News”. </p>

<p>Born in the Bronx and raised throughout New York, Dean&#8217;s travels made it easy for him to communicate with all walks of life.&nbsp; After dividing his college career between classes and a 6-year term in the U.S. Army reserves, Dean ultimately made the choice to devote his career to comedy.&nbsp; Although his fellow soldiers loved his impressions of their drill sergeant, Dean spent many an afternoon doing push-ups to pay for his comedic talent.&nbsp; That talent paid off and Dean found his career after participating a college talent show.</p>

<p>Armed with a degree in communications, Dean became an in-demand comic, and landed his first big break on Russell Simmons&#8217; “Def Comedy Jam.” Though the show is renown for it&#8217;s blue humor, Dean found a way to break the traditional mold with his mainstream appeal. Subsequently, he was a featured comedian on “Showtime at the Apollo” a few years later. Dean followed his TV appearances by starring in numerous commercials, and also worked with Spike Lee on the hit feature film “The Original Kings of Comedy” </p>

<p>Edwards has since earned a reputation as a headlining favorite at comedy clubs and colleges across the country. An international sensation, Dean was chosen to perform at the Jozi, Cape Town and Durban Comedy Festival’s in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban South Africa, as well as Saudi Arabia in late, 2009. More recently, Dean completed a tour of the Middle East, performing in front of more than 10,000 comedy fans: beginning in Cairo, Egypt and ending in Kuwait. </p>

<p>Next up, Dean’s vocal talents can be heard in Dreamworks upcoming Halloween classic, SCARED SHREKLESS and he can be seen starring in the upcoming independent feature, APRIL FOOLS. Dean’s first comedy CD, “REAL TALK WITH FAKE PEOPLE, Volume 1” debuted at the top of Itunes comedy charts in 2009 and he plans to release an hour long special/DVD with Salient Media in late-2010.</p>

His life as a sheltered son of Pentecostal ministers from Waco, TX, and working at the White House (during three administrations) has made for an energetic comedy style that combines an engaging stage presence with a sarcastic zing.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Tim started doing stand-up after 8 years in the US Army. After five years he has slowly began trying to leave his professional day job in Washington DC and go head first into wherever the entertainment industry would take him. Since then, Tim has worked with todays biggest names in comedy from Pablo Francisco, Daniel Tosh, Ted Alexandro, and Bob Marley. After performing at the DC Comedy Fest, he was named one of the funniest comics in The District.

  <td>From Comedy Central’s Premium Blend, NBC’s Today Show, and Last Comic Standing</td>
  <td><p>Karith has appeared on Comedy Central’s Premium Blend, NBC’s Today Show and Last Comic Standing, VH-1’s Best Week Ever, Awesomely Bad…and Black to the Future series. You may have also seen her on BET, BRAVO, and The Travel and Fine Living Channels. Her greatest triumphs include performing on Showtime at the Apollo (getting applause, not boos), doing live audience warm-up for the Oprah Winfrey Show and later as a guest on Oprah. Her comedy CD “Karith Foster: Straight Outta Plano is currently in rotation on Sirius/XM’s Raw Dog Comedy Channel.</p>

<p>Karith credits her entrée into the entertainment world to her upbringing in the affluent suburb of Plano, Texas, where irony of all ironies she starred in her high school’s otherwise ALL WHITE production of A Raisin in the Sun. Two guesses who the raisin was! This self-described “Huxtable” has been nicknamed “Princess” by several friends who are convinced she’s actually a Jewish girl from Long Island trapped in that body—which would technically make her a JA-AP (Jewish African-American Princess). So, in her case it’s not “talk to the hand,” but “talk to the manicure.” She may never have cooked a full meal in her life but she has the Zagats Restaurant Guide practically memorized- that’s gotta count for something.</p>

<p>Karith is bi-coastal residing in both NYC and LA. When she’s not headlining colleges and clubs across the country she performs weekly at a variety of NYC comedy clubs including: The Cellar, The Comic Strip Live, Caroline’s on Broadway, Gotham Comedy Club, Stand-up New York Comedy Club, Broadway Comedy Club &amp; Café, New York Comedy Club. When out West you can find her at Pasadena’s Ice House, LA’s Improv, The Laugh Factory, The Comedy Store and The Story Salon.</p>

<p>Karith has also transitioned her comedy into a speaking career and is one of the most sought after speakers for colleges and corporations in the areas of: Diversity, Leadership, Women, Team Building and Motivation. She is also the founder of “Laughter Bootcamp” a workshop, which she leads for groups, social organizations,and corporations. She is the author of “Laugh Your Way to Happiness: 101 Ways to Have a Great Laugh” and the soon to be released children’s book “Lealah Finds Love.”</p>

<p>Karith was recently honored by being named spokesperson for the amazing organization Books for Kids Foundation- which promotes literacy among all children with a special emphasis on low-income and at-risk preschool-aged children. Books for Kids creates libraries, donates books, and partners with literacy programs to develop the critical early foundation and skills which young children need to be successful in life.</p>

<p>Karith lives by the comic’s law: All is fair in love and comedy.

Trackman has also done numerous television appearances in Canada on the &#8220;Mike Bullard Show&#8221; and in Holland on the &#8220;Comedy Factory&#8221; and the &#8220;Raymaan Is Laat Show&#8221;.</p>

<p>In addition to Trackman headlining around the country, both of his CDs have received critical acclaim and were produced by XM Radio&#8217;s comedy program director, Joel Haas. Trackman is played regularly and has had specials (featuring his CDs) on both XM and Sirius radio. Other venues Trackman headlines include &#8220;The Improv&#8221; (Las Vegas, Nevada), &#8220;Tommy T&#8217;s&#8221; (Pleasonton, California), &#8220;The Stardome&#8221; (Hoover, Alabama), &#8220;Hilarities&#8221; (Cleveland, Ohio), Helium Comedy Club (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) and the legendary &#8220;Punchline&#8221; (San Francisco, California). Brad&#8217;s first performance ever at &#8220;Punchline&#8221; was to a sold out room where he soon won a standing ovation.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re wondering what makes Brad such a unique comedian, it&#8217;s his versatility, his ability to work squeaky clean and still kill. Maybe that&#8217;s why &#8220;Radio Shack&#8221; had Trackman headline the &#8220;Net Together Concert&#8221; in Times Square with a 20-foot tall jumbotron behind him and a crowd of 5,000 people in front of him. This concert was also simulcast in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Trackman has opened for Dana Carvey, Joan Rivers and Weird Al Yankovic in arenas with crowds of up to 7,000. His pursuit of ensuring other people&#8217;s happiness is still evolving, as is Brad. Despite all these major accomplishments, Brad considers his biggest breaks in entertaiment were meeting his wife, Christina (who, at the time, booked &#8220;Carolines on Broadway&#8221;) and having their son Tyler.</p>

<p>Trackman has been teaching stand up comedy for the past eight years in both Princeton NJ and New York City. Brad than decided to open his own school The Philadelphia Comedy Academy out of Helium Comedy Club which has become one of the most successful stand up comedy programs in the country. He was also recently hired to teach stand up comedy at the highly prestigious Ivy League University of Pennsylvania/Wharton School of Business as well. He also does two-day seminars in the many cities he headlines around the country.
